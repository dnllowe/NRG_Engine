# NRG_Engine
Extends functions of Cocos2dx Engine

# Intro
Before I officially began working on my indie game side projects as Out of Orbit Games, I tentatively used the name Neo Retro Games. The Neo Retro Games Engine (NRG Engine) isn't really a game engine, so much as it is a handful of helpful abstractions and helper classes I used on top of the open source Cocos2dx Game Engine. 

# Use Case
I specifically made these classes for the purposes of my own games and side projects. Hopefully, though, you can take a look and find something useful for yourself, or at least find some inspiration for how to tackle problems for your own games.

# Documentation
Sorry, it's lacking quite a bit. Hopefully the header and source files will help illustrate what each class is for and how they work. You can see these classes in action in the Tap 3 source code (https://github.com/dnllowe/tap3)
